# Aqua Security MicroScanner Orb for CircleCi

## What is the MicroScanner Orb?

Aqua Security's MicroScanner enables you to check your container images for vulnerabilities. If your image has any known high-severity issue, MicroScanner can fail the image build, making it easy to include as a step in your CI/CD pipeline.

The MicroScanner itself is a small, easy to implement container vulnerability scanning tool. It has been embedded in the MicroScanner Orb to be called upon during more complex workflows. The MicroScanner has two modes: community and enterprise. This Orb allows for both modes. When used with a community mode scanning token as described in the MicroScanner GitHub site token holders may run 100 scans a month  When an Enterprise Aqua Console is specified, the MicroScanner will utilize a more granular, configurable scan policy.

> Note: The freely-available Community Edition is aimed at individual developers and open source projects who may not have control over the full CI/CD pipeline. The <a href="https://www.aquasec.com/use-cases/continuous-image-assurance/">Aqua Security commercial solution</a> is designed to be hooked into your CI/CD pipeline after the image build is complete, and/or to scan images from a public or private container registry.

> Another note: this freely-available Community Edition of MicroScanner scans for vulnerabilities in the image's installed packages. Aqua's commercial customers have access to [additional Enterprise Edition scanning features](#aqua-security-edition-comparison), such as scanning with a customized vulnerability policy, looking at vulnerable files, PII and other sensitive data included in a container image as well as audit logging.

The MicroScanner Orb is an easy way to get started creating free, automated vulnerability assessment reports. These reports are posted to CircleCi's build artifact area.


## How to use the Aqua MicroScanner Orb in your config.yml

### 1. Register for a MicroScanner token as described [here.](https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner)

### 2. Create a context in the CircleCi portal and assign the required variables
    Navigate to Org Settings > Context and create a context

</p>

### 3. Within your new context create an environment variable named "AQUA_TOKEN" and populate it with the token from step #1

</p>

### 4. Add the required configuration to your build configuration

The following `.circleci/config.yml` is an example of a docker build configuration based on https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/

```bash
# CircleCI build config example for the implementation of the Aqua Security MicroScanner
# https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner

version: 2.1

orbs:
  microscanner: aquasecurity/microscanner@dev:0.0.1

jobs:
  docker-build:
    executor: microscanner/default
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: docker build -t circleci/node:latest .

workflows:
  scan-image:
    jobs:
      - docker-build
      - microscanner/scan-image:
          requires:
            - docker-build
          context: microscanner
          image: circleci/node:latest

```

Add the first 2 lines of the following example to the beginning of 
your `.circleci/config.yml` and set the CircleCI `version` to the minimum version `2.1`.

```shell
orbs:
  microscanner: aquasecurity/microscanner@dev:0.0.1
 ...
```

Then add a CircleCi executor.

```shell
 ...
jobs:
  docker-build:
    executor: microscanner/default
 ...
```

The final step is to edit your workflow to trigger a vulnerability scan.

```shell
 ...
workflows:
  scan-image:
    jobs:
      - docker-build
      - microscanner/scan-image:
          requires:
            - docker-build
          context: microscanner
          image: circleci/node:latest
```

## Viewing Scan Results
By default, the MicroScanner will pass a `0` for a passing scan (that is, a scan that has no high ranking vulnerabilities) and a `4` for a failing scan. This `4` of course stops the CircleCi process.

A report is created upon a failed scan. This is linked to within the CircleCi as an artifact. Navigate to the artifact tab in the CircleCi dashboard for viewing this report.
